# Class 4 - Array Problems (Easy)

## Understanding Arrays
- Contiguous memory
- Language dependent
    - Name (aka lists)
    - Fixed or flexible size
    - Resizing factor

## Data Structures Big O Breakdown

| | Access | Search | Insertion | Deletion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Array | O(1) | O(N) | O(N) | O(N) |
| Dictionary/Hash Table | O(1) | O(N) | O(1) | O(1) |
| Linked List | O(N) | O(N) | O(1) | O(1) |
| Binary Tree | O(log(N)) | O(log(N)) | O(log(N)) | O((log(N)) |

## Practice Problems
Remember the following principles when you practice:
1. Breathe
2. Listen to understand
3. Use examples
4. State a brute force solution
5. Optimize
6. Break it down
7. Solve or simplify
8. Look back and refactor/test

### Array Problems (Easy)
Problem 1
- Write a function that finds the minimum and maximum in an array 
Problem 2
- Write a function that reverses an array in place
Problem 3
- Write a function that finds the missing number in an array
Problem 4
- Write a function that moves all negative elements to the end of an array
Problem 5
- You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the ith customer has in the jth bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has. A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.
- Example: 
    - input_accounts = `[[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]`
    - output = `17`
Problem 6
- Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
- Example:
    - input_array = `[2, 5, 6, 3, 9]`
    - input_target = `9`
    - output = `[2, 3]`
Problem 7
- Write a function that finds the occurrence of a number in an array
Problem 8
- Write a function that finds common elements in three sorted arrays
Problem 9
- Write a function that sorts 0s, 1s, and 2s
Problem 10
- Write a function that sorts a given array of numbers
