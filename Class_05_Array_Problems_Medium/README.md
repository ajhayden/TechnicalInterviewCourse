# Class 5 - Array Problems (Medium)

## Understanding Arrays
- Contiguous memory
- Language dependent
    - Name (aka lists)
    - Fixed or flexible size
    - Resizing factor

## Practice Problems
Remember the following principles when you practice:
1. Breathe
2. Listen to understand
3. Use examples
4. State a brute force solution
5. Optimize
6. Break it down
7. Solve or simplify
8. Look back and refactor/test

### Array Problems (Easy)
Problem 1
- Write a program that uses binary search to find a given target number. The function should return the index of the target number if found
Problem 2
- Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. Find the minimum number in the sorted array. You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
    - input_array = `[3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]`
    - output = `1`
- Hint: use binary search
Problem 3
- Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. Find the maximum number in the sorted array. You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
    - input_array = `[3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]`
    - output = `6`
- Hint: use binary search
Problem 4
- Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
    - input_array = `[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 10, 1, -5, 4]`
    - output = `16`
Problem 5
- Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
    - input_array = `[8, 2, -1, -2, -3, 2]`
    - output = `32`
Problem 6
- Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1, return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
- Note: Please solve it without division
    - input_array = `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
    - output = [`24, 12, 8, 6]`
