# Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
# s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
# All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

# Input: s = ‘egg’, t = ‘add’ // true
# Input: s = ‘foo’, t = ‘bar’ // false
# Input: s = ‘paper’, t = ‘title’ // true

s1 = 'egg'
t1 = 'add'
s2 = 'foo'
t2 = 'bar'
s3 = 'paper'
t3 = 'title'
