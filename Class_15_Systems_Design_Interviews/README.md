# System Design Interviews

## System Design Approach
- Understand the goals
    - Inputs, outputs, & users
- Establish scope
    - Authentication, mobile or web or both, analytics
- Design for the right scale
    - Read to write ratio, concurrent requests, etc
- Start high-level then drill down
- Data structures and algorithms
    - Scaling requirements
- Tradeoffs
    - Database, caching solutions, frameworks

## Practice Problem
- How would you design a tinyURL?
- Principles to consider:
    - Requirement
        - Clarify assumptions
        - Define scope
    - Traffic
    - URL Length
    - Data capacity model
    - URL shortening logic
        - Base62
        - MD5
    - Database

## Additional Problems
Problem 1
- Explain a scenario where you would use a web application? Give examples why.
Problem 2
- Explain a scenario where you would use a locally installed application? Give examples why.
Problem 3
- How would you design a search engine?
