# Unit 1 - Course Intro

## Why are we doing this course?
- Although Information Systems students have the skills for the daily needs of technical sofware engineering roles, they aren’t prepared for the technical interviews required to land the job.
- Students don’t know the specific skills needed to pass these interviews.
- Students don’t feel adequately supported by the IS department in gaining these skills.
- Students don’t know where to start in their preparation.
- Students feel stress and anxiety due to the unknown nature of these interviews.

## Course Outcomes
- Students will learn principles to help them be successful in many types of technical interviews.
- Students will clearly communicate their thought process and critically analyze their code.
- Students will become more confident in their ability to perform in technical interviews.

## Progressing through the Course
- The course is designed for you to complete an assignment before participating in the next unit. As you progress through this course the README files will instruct you on course content and provide you with homework assignments. Homework assignments for each unit will be found under the "Homework" sub-directory. For example, homework to complete before starting Unit_03_Recursion_Problems will be found under Unit_03_Recursion_Problems -> Homework -> README.md. *Note: The first two units do not have homework assignments.*
