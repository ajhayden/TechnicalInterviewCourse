### General Advice  
1. Do not apply to your top companies first
    - Your first interview is going to be bad. That's normal. Don't make it be at your top company.
    - Interview with 3 companies you don't care about to get practice
    - People dislike interviewing and want to get the process done as fast as possible (which is understandable), but they'll apply for their favorite roles first and perform badly. Do not do this.

2. "*Cracking The Coding Interview* is the Bible. Throw it at everyone you know."

3. Communication
    - Talking smoothly and avoiding silence is powerful
    - A lot of people get stuck and sit for 30 seconds in silence. Don't do that--let your interviewer help you.
    - Talking makes you look better and will help you because the interviewer will give you hints. They want you to succeed.
    - Attack a problem from multiple perspectives, show all the tools in your toolbox
    - "Even if you don't have the right key to the door, try all of the keys on your keychain to show what you've got to work with. Don't try just one key and then sit there when it doesn't work."
    - Give your interviewer every reason to throw you a life raft as you work.

4. Differentiating yourself
    - "You need to be qualified, but the bottom line for me is: do I want to work with this candidate?"
    - Don't act like a jerk
    - He would rather hire someone who is less skilled but communicates well, is receptive to criticism, and is open to learn.

5. Keep a timeline for every company on a spreadsheet
    - Record details about the role, status of your application, etc.

6. Always be ready to answer questions about previous work
    - Make sure you can go over previous work and articulate it well
    - Your interviewers won't be expecting an intern/new grad role to have all the answers or have complex design considerations, so you don't need to act like you do

### Interviewing Advice
- Analysis paralysis
    - In case interviews, candidates start going down rabbit holes of asking detailed questions, but they never get to the point where they conclude anything.
    - Stop yourself when you're not making any progress. Make sure you're leading to the root issue.

- Common mistake: staying too high level
    - Candidates don't have enough substance behind their knowledge
    - You have to demonstrate that you know what you're talking about
    - Candidates think there's only one possible solution to the case, but there's always many solutions. There's rarely one right answer.

- Practice, practice, practice
    - Don't let your interview be the first interview you have ever done
    - The more you practice, the more comfortable you are
    - Do some basic googling and find practic questions

- Plan it out
    - For behavioral questions: think through experiences, write them down, and plan out answers ahead of time
        - Side projects, INTEX, capstone projects, school, work, previous internships, etc. are all good experiences
    - Keep an internship journal about what you're learning, so you have details for your next interview
    - After you've started your first job, keep taking notes
        - Check in every 3-4 months and update your resume, even if you aren't looking for a new job
        - Don't rely on what's in your head, because you won't remember
