## Books and Courses
[Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1XP47KPXMXKSM&keywords=cracking+the+code&qid=1641257118&sprefix=cracking%2520the%2520c%2Caps%2C389&sr=8-2) by Gayle Laakman McDowell
- This is one of the most popular and thorough technical interviewing resources. We used this as a guide for much of our course content and practice problems you'll see in lecture/homework.
- The book goes beyond the scope of this course, but if you want to work further it's a great resource.
- If you want to work at a FAANG company, this book will teach you more advanced topics you should know.  

[JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/) by Colt Steele
- Katie used this Udemy course to teach herself data structures basics. Colt makes the content very approachable and easy to understand. It's also in JavaScript which is often a well-known language for IS students (many other resources teach in C++ or Java).

[Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People]() by Aditya Y. Bhargava
- This book has been recommended by other IS students. It explains common algorithms in an easy-to-understand way.

## Practice
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)/[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- These two websites are the most popular ways to practice for interviews. They provide problems of all types and difficulties, with an IDE interface for you to practice writing solutions.

[GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- Another excellent source for practice problems and explanations.

[Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/)
- Matches you with a partner and gives you live mock technical interview practice.

[Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions)
- 75 commonly asked LeetCode questions.
- Studying all 75 will give you a wide range of problem categories and help you with other similar problems.

[Visualgo.net](https://visualgo.net/)
- Helpful visualizations for common data structures and algorithms.

## Handbooks
[Tech Interview Handbook](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/)
- Provides practical advice and a roadmap for the entire interview process, from resume revision to interview formats to essential DSA you should know.

[Front End Interview Handbook](https://frontendinterviewhandbook.com/)
- Just like the Tech Interview Handbook, but focused on unique front end interviews: web framework fundamentals, system design, and coding questions.

## Job Hunting

- Spreadsheet of Utah companies hiring across functional departments

## Mental Health
[BYU CAPS](https://caps.byu.edu/)
- The job search process (and life in general) can be stressful. Did you know that the Marriott School has its own satellite CAPS office with therapists exclusively for business students? Specify that you're a business student when you call the office and you'll get an appointment much sooner.
