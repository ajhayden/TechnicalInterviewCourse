# Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
# You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
# You may assume no duplicates exist in the array
# This problem came from leetcode.com

# Try doing this problem with a runtime complexity that is close to O(log n)

input_array = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]
target = 0
# Output = 4
