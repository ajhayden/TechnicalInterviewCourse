# Given an array nums of n integers, are three elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0?
# Find all unique triplets in the array which give the sum of zero
# Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets
# This problem came from leetcode.com

input_array = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4, 4]
# a solution set is:
# [
#     [-1, 0, 1],
#     [-1, -1, 2]
# ]
