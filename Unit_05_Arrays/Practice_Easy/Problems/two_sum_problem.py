# Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice
# This problem came from leetcode.com

input_array = [2, 5, 6, 3, 9] 
input_target = 9
# Output = [2, 3]
