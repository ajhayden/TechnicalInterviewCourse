# Linked List (Easy) Homework

- Watch the following video and follow along with the code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njTh_OwMljA

- Look at this article at the different languages using a linked list: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-1-introduction/
    - Which language makes the most sense to you?
    - We will be using Python in class

- For this homework, you'll review the linked list reverse() function and add the remove() function to the code found under Class_12_Linked_List_Problems_Medium -> Homework -> python_linked_list.py.

- Reverse:
    - Watch this video to visualize using pointers to reverse a linked list: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7y_hoT_YZI
    - Then, practice drawing the reversing process on a piece of paper. (Tip: use a small linked list of 3-4 nodes so it doesn't take you too long)
    - Then write the code to reverse a linked list. If you need an extra challenge, try writing it recursively (that is not required or expected though).
- Remove:
    - Watch the following video to visualize deleting a node from a linked list. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCRGaWXGOKU She uses Java to code the solution, but don't worry about the Java code unless it's helpful to you. Focus on the visualization/process steps. You can also use VisuAlgo to visualize this if you'd like.
    - Then, practice drawing the removal process on a piece of paper. (Tip: use a small linked list of 3-4 nodes so it doesn't take you too long)
    - Then try to write the code to remove a node from a linked list.
