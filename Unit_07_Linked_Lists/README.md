## Data Structures Big O Breakdown

| | Access | Search | Insertion | Deletion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Array | O(1) | O(N) | O(N) | O(N) |
| Dictionary/Hash Table | O(1) | O(N) | O(1) | O(1) |
| Linked List | O(N) | O(N) | O(1) | O(1) |
| Binary Tree | O(log(N)) | O(log(N)) | O(log(N)) | O((log(N)) |

## Linked Lists
- What are linked lists?
    - A sequence of data elements, which are connected together via links
- What is a node?
    - An element of a linked list
- What are the two node fields?
    - Data: contains the value to be stored in the node
    - Next: contains reference to next node on the list

## When to use Linked Lists vs Array
1. When you need constant-time insertions/deletions from the list (such as in real-time computing where time predictability is absolutely critical)
2. When you don't know how many items will be in the list. With arrays, you may need to re-declare and copy memory if the array grows too big
3. When you don't need random access to any elements
4. When you want to be able to insert items in the middle of the list (such as a priority queue)

## Creating a Linked List
1. Start with a single node
2. Join nodes to get linked list
3. Add required methods to LinkedList class

### Linked List Problems (Easy)
Problem 1
- Write a program to remove duplicates from a sorted list
Problem 2
- Write a program to find the intersection of two linked lists
Problem 3
- Write a program to merge two sorted lists
Problem 4
- Write a program to delete N nodes after M nodes of a linked list

*An empty file to write code for these problems can be found under Unit_07_Linked_Lists -> Practice -> Problems. Additionally, solutions for each problem can be found under Unit_07_Linked_Lists -> Practice -> Solutions.*
