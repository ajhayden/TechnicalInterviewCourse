# Graph Problems

## Understanding Graphs
- Graphs are representations of a set of objects where pairs are connected by links. The objects are called vertices and the links are called edges.
- Undirected links are links that are bidirectional. For example, you can go from a to b or you can go from b to a.
- Directed links are links that are one-directional. For example, you can only go from a to b or you can only go from b to a.

## Graph Problems
Problem 1:
- Create a breadth first search for the a graph using iteration.
Problem 2:
- Create a depth first search for the a graph using iteration.
Problem 3:
- Create a detpth first search for a graph using recursion.
Problem 4:
- Write a function, hasPath, that takes in an object representing the adjacency list of a directed acyclic graph and two nodes (src, dst). The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not there exists a directed path between the source and destination nodes.
Problem 5:
- Write a function, undirected_path, that takes in array of edges for an undirected graph and two nodes (node_a and node_b). The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not there exists a path between node_a and node_b.
