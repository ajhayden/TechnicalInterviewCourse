# Unit 14 - System Design Interviews

## System Design Approach
- Understand the goals
    - Inputs, outputs, & users
- Establish scope
    - Authentication, mobile or web or both, analytics
- Design for the right scale
    - Read to write ratio, concurrent requests, etc
- Start high-level then drill down
- Data structures and algorithms
    - Scaling requirements
- Tradeoffs
    - Database, caching solutions, frameworks

## Practice Problem
- How would you design a tinyURL?
- Principles to consider:
    - Requirement
        - Clarify assumptions
        - Define scope
    - Traffic
    - URL Length
    - Data capacity model
    - URL shortening logic
        - Base62
        - MD5
    - Database

## Additional Problems
- Problem 1: Explain a scenario where you would use a web application? Give examples why.
- Problem 2: Explain a scenario where you would use a locally installed application? Give examples why.
- Problem 3: How would you design a search engine?

*An empty file to write code for these problems can be found under Unit_14_Systems_Design_Interviews -> Practice -> Problems. Additionally, solutions for each problem can be found under Unit_14_Systems_Design_Interviews -> Practice -> Solutions.*
